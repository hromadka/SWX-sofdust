Temperature Sensor
-	Reports temperature in degrees F, every N=5 seconds
-	Reports to cloud
-	Flashes onboard blue LED (D7) with every report
-	Uses OneWire library to read sensor
-	Code from https://docs.particle.io/tutorials/projects/maker-kit/#tutorial-4-temperature-logger  
-	Using a 3-wire temperature sensor like the DS18B20:
-- red wire on 3.3 V
-- yellow wire on D4 pin
-- black wire on GND
-- 4.7K resistor across yellow & red wires
